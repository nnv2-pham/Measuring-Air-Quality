There are many things that spring to my mind as I reflect back on this assignment. The first time I read it, I was totally confused. I started with mentionable enthusiasm as I have spent every two weeks reading, researching and finishing each task. Despite completing my coursework requirement on schedule, I had three main issues. Before beginning to do task one, I reviewed how to read and write a CSV file from learning materials, which is a crucial step before cleaning data. However, when moving to the next step, using the “for” loop to crop or clean data, it did not work and appeared an error like “the TypeError: ‘int’ object is not iterable”. I did some research and came across a variety of suggestions but they still had the same error. Eventually, thanks to the support and explanation from Dr Prakash Chatterjee, I understood the core problem and fixed my error. After accomplishing the first two tasks, I got stuck in task three when creating a Python script to establish a new database and input the data from the CSV file. I had no idea where to commence, but after looking at several examples from class workshops and reading materials about two popular methods such as MariaDB and PyMySQL, I got the overall picture of what needed to be done and how to do it. In contrast to task three and task four, which required the usage of a SQL database, task five involved using one of four types of NoSQL data stores to build the chosen database and import data. Since there was not enough time to provide in-depth instruction on NoSQL in the data fundamental management course, I spent a long time researching each type of NoSQL database as well as how to apply the platforms on which each type was handled. I ultimately decided to use the Key-Value NoSQL Database and the Dynamo platform. The solutions that stem from the difficulties I confronted that it made me gain more deep knowledge in the data field and I believe it will be beneficial to me in my future career path.
Although data visualization did not require in this assignment, it is one of the crucial processes to understand the data and obtain useful insights. Data visualization is one way to communicate information to customers (Conner, C., Samuel, J., Kretinin, A., Samuel, Y., & Nadeau, L., 2020). In the early days of data visualization, the most popular approach was using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to convert the data into a table, line graph, or pie chart (Rees, D., & Laramee, R. S., 2019). However, in recent years, data scientists and researchers employing a few Python modules in order to visualize data as well as better understand the relationships between variables in the dataset by pie charts, histograms, and more intricate representations such as infographics, bubble clouds, bullet graphs, heat maps, fever charts, and time series charts. The first Python data visualization library is Matplotlib. Despite being over a decade ago, it is still the most popular and widely-used Python module for complex data visualization among data scientists. It works well with other Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn to reduce the amount of code to write. Besides that, Matplotlib can produce attractive data visualization including bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots and more (Yim, A., Chung, C., & Yu, A., 2018). Based on Matplotlib data visualization, the second Python library is Seaborn. It is a high-level interface for creating aesthetically appealing and valuable statistics. Seaborn works well with Numpy and Pandas data structures for visualizing univariate and bivariate data or plotting time series data (Waskom, M. L., 2021). Additionally, seaborn can generate visually appealing data visualisations like a histogram, bar plot, box plot, violin plot, a heat map and more. Similar to Seaborn, Altair is a Python-based statistical data visualization package. It is a declarative language for generating, preserving and sharing interactive data visualization designs and its foundations are Vega and Vega-Lite. Altair can also produce eye-catching data visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, error charts, and stemplots. (VanderPlas, Granger, Heer, Moritz, Wongsuphasawat, Satyanarayan, and Sievert,2018). The final Python library that could be used to visualize the “air-quality-continuous data” is ggplot. It is a Python data visualization library built on the R programming language's ggplot2. Ggplot can build data visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots, and error charts.
This assignment was a great opportunity so I could review several theories that I have learned throughout twelve weeks and apply them to a real project as well as prepare for my exam. Even though the Programming for Data Science course taught me how to utilize Python tools for data analysis from basic to sophisticated, I did not have many opportunities to put my knowledge to deal with a huge dataset. This coursework has improved my ability to use Python tools to address a variety of issues and aspects. Moreover, I have acquired about how to draw the entity-relationship diagram step by step from identifying entities, attributes, its relationships to drawing out the ERD model in the first, second and third-norm form, which helps to remove redundancy in a table (Bala & Martin, 1997; Codd, 1970; Date, 2003; Mannino, 2006; Rob & Coronel, 2006). Besides using the Python and R tool to calculate and find the relationship between variables, I have discovered SQL, which can quickly insert, update, remove, create, and drop tables as well as retrieve data from databases (Chan, H. C., Wei, K. K., & Siau, K. L., 1993). For example, I quickly found the average of PM2.5 and VPM2.5 for each station in two tables. In the real life, SQL database ideas use across industries. In an organization, the salary management system calculates the monthly pay, taxes, and social security of every employee. Using the SQL database to calculate the salaries by using employee data such as name, designation, pay scale or benefits and attendance records. In contrast to SQL databases, I have learnt about NoSQL databases, which are not tabular like relational databases and they manage data storage in a different way. According to the data model, these databases are categorized and popular types such as document, graph, wide-column and key-value. There is a plethora of platforms in four types of databases such as CouchBase, MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j, I have just researched MongoDB and applied my knowledge to task five. Even though I haven't had a chance to investigate and comprehend each platform, I believe that after completing this coursework I will take more time to explore each platform in order to increase my understanding of the data area. NoSQL has been used by some big data, cloud, and social media firms in the twenty-first century, including Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, and others. This assignment has assisted me in reviewing and realizing certain gaps in my knowledge that I need to learn more about.
To sum up, I found this assignment to be very challenging. I had to admit that when I was initially introduced to this coursework, I became anxious. After all the obstacles I had to overcome and with Dr Prakash Chatterjee’s invaluable support over the course of three months, I am delighted and proud of the assignment I was able to accomplish.
